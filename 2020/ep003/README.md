George discusses [Google's Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) leaving its closed beta program, and what potential applications it would have for businesses, scholars, and hobbyists.

Alex brought an article about [Activation Atlases](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18251274/ai-artificial-intelligence-tool-machine-vision-algorithms) and we discussed the applicability to machine learning interpretability.

Lan lead a discussion about the paper [Attention is not Explanation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10186.pdf) from Sarthak Jain and Byron C. Wallace.  It explores the relationship between attention weights and feature importance scores (spoilers in the title).
